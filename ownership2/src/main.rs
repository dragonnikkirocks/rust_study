    //- control over memory, error free, faster runtime, smaller programm size
    //cons:
    //- slower write time, steeper learning curve

    //OWNERSHIP RULES
//1. Each value in Rust will have one owner
// 2. variable can have only one owner
// 3. when owner goes out of scope, value will be dropped

//s is allocated in heap
//dynamically
// the same if done in cpp - new keyword needed - we have to take care of 
//deallocation of memory

taking_ownership_of_string(s3); //s3 is moved to the function
//this is not valid as s3 is moved to the functipon
//basically rust does what cpp std::move does for anytging tghats stored dynamically in heap
// as strinf is stored in heap, passing it to a function, automatically moves it
//println!("After function call to taking_ownership_of_string, s3: {}", s3); //s2

//References are when you want to pass a variable to a function
//without taking ownership of it
//here refence to string is passed - this is called borrowing
// Passing in a refernces to a function is called borrowing

//references are immutable by default
// to make it mutable, we have to use mut keyword

//there can be multiple immutable references to a variable
// but only one mutable reference
// this is called aliasing
// this is to provent data race conditions where multiplle threads try to access
// same variable at the same time 
// this is not allowed in rust
// i.e. calculate_length2() and calculate_length() if called at same time from different threads
// it will try to access the same variable at the same time
// to prevent this, rust does not allow multiple mutable references

//Dangling references
// fn dangling_reference_example() -> &String{
//    //below code will not work as s is dropped after the function call 
//    //and the reference to s is returned which is left dangling i.e. ref points to a non exisiting var
//    // let s = String::from("Dangling ref example");
//    // s
